#  Yahoo Finance Stock Data Analysis Project

**Data Science & Financial Analysis Project**

Welcome! 
This project introduces **financial data analysis** using real-world stock market data from **Yahoo Finance**. It's designed to give hands-on experience with **data science, technical analysis, and portfolio optimization**. 

##  About This Project

Financial markets generate vast amounts of data, and understanding it requires combining **data science skills** with **financial knowledge**.

In this project, I:

* Retrieve historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API
* Clean, preprocess, and explore the data
* Implement **technical indicators** such as moving averages
* Backtest trading strategies like **moving average crossover** and **mean reversion**
* Build and optimize a **portfolio of stocks** to minimize risk
* Apply **machine learning** techniques to analyze stock behavior
* Explore **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** and construct the **Efficient Frontier**

This project bridges theory and practice, giving insights into **financial data analysis and investment decision-making**.

##  Dataset

**Yahoo Finance API** – Download historical stock prices and market data for multiple tickers to perform analysis and modeling.
